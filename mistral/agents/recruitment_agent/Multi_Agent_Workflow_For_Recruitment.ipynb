        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The Multi Agent Workflow For Recruitment is an automated system designed to help streamline the hiring process through specialized AI agents working in harmony to improve candidate evaluation, save time and resources, and improve overall hiring outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Today's recruitment landscape faces three critical challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overwhelming Volume**: Recruiters struggle to efficiently process large numbers of applications, often missing qualified candidates.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Manual Inefficiency**: Traditional resume screening is time-consuming, inconsistent, and vulnerable to bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Poor Candidate Experience**: Slow response times and fragmented communication damage employer brand and lose top talent.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Ineffective recruitment directly impacts business outcomes through:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reduced Performance**: Missing qualified candidates leads to suboptimal hires and team performance\n",
        "- **Business Delays**: Extended hiring cycles postpone critical projects and initiatives\n",
        "- **Higher Costs**: Inefficient processes and prolonged vacancies increase recruitment costs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "The Multi Agent Workflow For Recruitment addresses these challenges through a coordinated system of specialized AI agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **DocumentAgent**: Intelligently extracts and processes text from resumes and job descriptions using advanced Mistral's OCR\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **JobAnalysisAgent**: Analyzes job descriptions to identify required skills, experience, and qualifications\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ResumeAnalysisAgent**: Parses resumes to create structured candidate profiles with key capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **MatchingAgent**: Evaluates candidates against job requirements with nuanced understanding beyond keyword matching\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **EmailCommunicationAgent**: Generates personalized email communications and schedules interviews with qualified candidates\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **CoordinatorAgent**: Orchestrates the entire workflow between agents for seamless operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution uses Mistral LLM for language understanding, structured output mechanisms for consistent data extraction, and Mistral OCR for document parsing."

        "\n",
        "HireFive needs to hire a Senior Data Scientist with machine learning expertise. The job description specifies requirements including 3+ years of experience, proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks, and a Master's degree in a quantitative field. From a pool of candidate resumes, the workflow automatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Extracts structured requirements from the job description, identifying critical skills\n",
        "- Parses all the resumes, creating standardized profiles with skills, experience, and education\n",
        "- Evaluates each candidate, assigning scores like \"Technical Skills: 32/40\" and \"Experience: 25/30\"\n",
        "- Identifies candidates scoring above the 70-point threshold\n",
        "- Automatically sends personalized interview invitations with scheduling links to these candidates\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire process completes in minutes, providing HireFive's hiring manager with a ranked list of qualified candidates while eliminating hours of manual resume screening."
